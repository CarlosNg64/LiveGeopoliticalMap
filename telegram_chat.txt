😌 Big Israeli Telegram channel (33,904 subscribers):

The US has expressed concern to Ukraine over its attacks on Russian radars used to deter a nuclear attack. Look what an ally this is. First it invests huge sums in Ukraine and actually causes an anti-Russian coup in the country in 2014, then when the promiscuous American behavior leads to war, it barely supplies Ukraine with weapons, restrains it all the time and limits its reactions to the invasion. Reminds you of something?

🇦🇫📈📃 — In a move to promote freedom of enterprise and small-medium business, the Government of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (Taliban/IEA) announced tax exemption for all businessmen and abolished taxes for all businesses up to $28,000 USD (£20,000) or 2 Million AFN

In statement, IEA official Wakeel Mubariz said:
"Shopkeepers with annual sales of up to two million Afghanis are fully exempt from paying any fixed tax.

And for shopkeepers and businessmen with annual sales exceeding two million Afghanis, a reduced fixed tax rate of 0.3 percent will be applied instead of 0.5 percent".

🛡 🇵🇸 🇮🇱 IDF is using unmanned M113s in Gaza

🔶️ They can transport people. Israel has hundreds of active M113s and thousands in army depots that it can use, but the platforms are aging. Finding ways to make them relevant, rather than just let them collect dust, has been a challenge. One role for them was to put mortars on them so they could be used for firing 120 mm. mortars. Israel isn’t the only country trying to upgrade M113s. A report at Israel Defense earlier this year said Greece was turning to Israel to upgrade its own fleet of around 600 M113s.

🔶️ Other countries have sought to turn their M113s into Remote Control Vehicles or Robotic Combat Vehicles. A report at the website Engineering.com noted in October 2023 “four defense contractors will each supply two working prototypes of remote control vehicles (RCVs, aka tank drones) to the US Army for three different types of tanks – one small and expendable version (RCV Light), a medium version (RCV-M) and a large version (RCV Heavy) – the latter an automated version of the M1 Abrams.”

🔶️ Australia did the same thing, according to an April 2024 report at online Army Recognition. “Electro Optic Systems (EOS), a defense company based in Canberra, equipped the M113 APC with its R400 remote weapons system for the trials, which took place in the Puckapunyal Military Area. This initiative is part of a broader project by the army aimed at transforming the M113 APCs into autonomous or optionally manned combat vehicles, named M113 AS4.”

🔶️ The War Zone website also reported in 2022 that “a photo posted to Twitter by Ronkainen shows what is identified as a version of BAE Systems’ Robotic Technology Demonstrator based on an M113 hull that has been cut down. The lower profile is evident because the engine hatch hinge is now above the top line of the vehicle.” This “uncrewed” vehicle showed up at the US Army’s EDGE 22 technology demonstration at Dugway Proving Ground in Utah.
